AWE
DEFINITION:Euphoric-like wonder at being in the presence of something vast enough to change one’s perceptions or understanding of the world

NOTES:Awe can enlighten or terrify (based on whether the character can handle what they have experienced), since it often leaves a person feeling small and insignificant. For the negative emotional reaction, please see the HORROR entry.

Feeling utterly present in the moment
Heightened senses; acute awareness of sensory stimuli (colors, smells, sensations, etc.)
Noticing and cataloging “the little things” as part of the experience
A desire to share the moment with others; feeling a sense of connection

Speaking when there’s no need, just to “break the spell”

WRITER’S TIP:When you’re describing a character’s emotional reaction through the eyes of another character, think about the depth of their relationship. If it’s close, a simple hair tuck or half-wave could be steeped in meaning which the point of view character can then share with the reader.
