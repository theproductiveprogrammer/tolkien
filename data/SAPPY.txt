SAPPY
DEFINITION:Overly sentimental; feeling an exaggerated sense of happiness, connectedness, or romance

NOTES:Sappiness is similar to nostalgia in the way it manifests. But while the former is typically a result of happier emotions, the latter is more often associated with wistfulness and sadness. If that’s the response you’re seeking, please see the NOSTALGIA entry.
