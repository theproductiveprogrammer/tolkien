POSITIVE ASPECTS:Inspirational characters are doers who aren’t afraid to follow their dreams and stand up for what they believe in. They are focused on goals that often lead to self-growth and willingly champion causes that bring about positive change for others. Characters like this are hard working, dedicated, and supportive in nature, cheering on others and encouraging them to be better. They unwittingly motivate people and frequently make a positive impact on others.

NEGATIVE ASPECTS:Sometimes inspirational characters can be so focused on the goal that they forget to enjoy small accomplishments and other constants in their lives. The inspiring character may become so accomplished that family and friends start to feel as though they are not striving hard enough themselves and that they should be accomplishing more. This may lead them to struggle with doubt or resentment and low self-esteem.
