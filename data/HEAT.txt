WRITER’S TIP:Heat is a natural amplifier, the perfect catalyst for pushing ordinary people to anger and violence. But characters and readers need a respite from the heat every once in awhile. Give them a break periodically by providing relief, a chance to rest and recharge so they’re better able to jump back into battle when the temperature rises again.
