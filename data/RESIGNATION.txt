WRITER’S TIP:Too many emotional internalizations in a scene can slow the pace considerably. If the character’s reflections are key to readers understanding what is being felt, try shifting some of these inner thoughts to active, realistic dialogue. It will increase the pace and still reveal the character’s feelings.
