POSITIVE ASPECTS:Objective characters do well in an advisor’s role because they are able to separate emotions from a volatile situation and proceed logically. When problems arise, they will go to great lengths to come up with a solution that is fair, based on the facts presented. Others respect that these characters take the time to investigate and gather information when making decisions. By being impartial, even when family or friends are involved, the advice of an objective character usually holds a lot of weight.

NEGATIVE ASPECTS:Objectivity can be a blessing and a curse, especially when family is involved; while an impartial character has no trouble separating his feelings from the situation, loved ones may take things personally or feel betrayed by the objective character. Some situations are not ideal for characters with this trait, especially when they must act quickly. Because of their need to know all the facts, opportunities may be lost by the time a decision is reached.

EXAMPLE FROM TV:Amy Farrah Fowler fromThe Big Bang Theoryis naturally objective, which suits her as a neurobiologist. She has a strong handle on her emotions and asks questions to get to the root of the issue at hand. Highly observant, she acts based on information and proven truth rather than being swayed by intuition or emotion. Even when personally involved, she is often able to pull herself out of emotional entanglements and take a logical approach to problem solving.Other Examples from Film:Lucius Fox (Batmanseries), Buster (Misery)
