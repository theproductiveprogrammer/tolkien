ATTRACTION

DEFINITION: Feeling a compelling sense of curiosity or pleasure in regards to a specific person

NOTE: a milder source of interest may come from an object of desire (such as seeing a coveted vintage car), but true attraction is usually between people. Thus, most suggestions here focus on human interactions.
