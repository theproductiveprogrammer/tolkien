Grimacing and wanting to look away but being unable to
The head recoiling from the source, eyes wide and staring
One’s words drying up mid-sentence
Opening the mouth to speak but being unable to find words
Trying to make sense of what one is experiencing by reading other people’s reactions
Speaking in fragments:This...He...Why...
Shaking the head in a slow, back-and-forth sweep of denial
The neck disappearing as shoulders rise and pull forward
Placing trembling fingertips against one’s open mouth
Eyebrows folding inward, the nose crinkling
Gripping one’s own throat or pressing a hand against the breastbone
Swallowing rapidly
Retreating; putting distance between oneself and the source
A slow intake of uneven breath (shuddery or shaky)
Turning the head to the side with the eyes tightly closed
Shielding the body (turning the torso to the side, crossing one’s arms over one’s chest, etc.)
Clamping a hand across one’s mouth and applying pressure
Stumbling back a step or two
Tripping and falling as one tries to create some distance
Pushing the back of the hand against one’s nose and looking away
Holding a shaking hand up between oneself and the source
Eyes that are unable to close
Cringing and rubbing one’s palm against the chest (above one’s heart)
The body contorting (knees drawing up, the torso twisting, arms pulling in, etc.)
Scraping one’s palms against clothing as if to rid them of something
Rubbing or pulling at the ears (if a sound is part of the experience)
Clapping the hands over the sides of one’s head to block out a specific noise
Forcing oneself to look down or to the side, breaking eye contact

Trying to verbally diffuse the moment (reasoning, bargaining, or placating) by talking slowly and enunciating one’s words
Moving slowly, using no sudden movements
Pulling loved ones close (gathering children, drawing a spouse near) to protect them

INTERNAL SENSATIONS:

Body tension (e.g., the stomach hardening)
The burn of bile in the back of the throat
An uncontrollable shudder that sweeps through one’s entire body
A sudden drop in body temperature
A hard thudding in the chest from an increased heart rate

MENTAL RESPONSES:
Losing track of spatial awareness (fumbling, clumsiness, stumbling, etc.)
Focusing on something small (like breathing) to feel more in control
Sudden revelations (putting together pieces of information that would have foreshadowed the negative experience, if one had only realized their significance)
A hyper-focus on the possible dangers associated with this moment (survival instinct)

Uncontrolled tears sliding down one’s cheeks and onto trembling lips
Looking for an escape
Turning and fleeing
A heart attack

SIGNS THAT THIS EMOTION IS BEING SUPPRESSED:
A hard, visible swallow as one’s lips press tight

WRITER’S TIP:Too much self-awareness can hurt emotional descriptions. Rarely do people think about the mechanics of what their bodies are doing (I felt my lungs swell with unspent breath), so weigh description more on showing a character’s reactions and behaviors naturally as they happen.
