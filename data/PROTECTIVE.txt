POSITIVE ASPECTS:Protective characters care deeply and have the best interest of their charges at heart. They are willing to set aside their own wants and needs to make sure the needs of their loves ones are taken care of. As their loved ones explore the world and their place within it, protectors act with vigilance to ensure that no harm comes to them. These characters are excellent at assessing possible risks and minimizing them, protecting their assets and resources from those who might take advantage, while offering help and counsel to loved ones who need it.

NEGATIVE ASPECTS:While protectors safeguard the people and things they care about, conflict arises when opinions differ as to the best course of action. Despite good intentions, power struggles can create a tug-of-war between the protector’s need to keep a charge safe and the charge’s desire for autonomy. When rules and precautions chafe, a charge may rebel, damaging the relationship or worse—intentionally putting himself in danger in order to prove that he can take care of himself.

EXAMPLE FROM TV:Dean Winchester from the seriesSupernaturalis extremely protective of not only his brother Sam, but anyone he considers family, including his fellow hunters. He will go to any lengths to protect them from the evil they fight day-to-day, going up against demons, Leviathans, the Four Horsemen, and Death himself. Risking his life for others is in a hunter’s job description, but Dean takes it a step further, selling his soul to the devil in order to save Sam’s life.Other Examples from Film and Literature:Leigh Anne Tuohy (The Blind Side), Korben Dallas (The Fifth Element), the unnamed father inThe Road
