POSITIVE ASPECTS:Efficient characters are task-oriented, organized, and can get a lot accomplished in a short period of time. They make decisions quickly and so don’t usually get bogged down in the details. They’re often good at implementing systems to streamline projects and processes, and will many times assume a leadership role just to get things moving.

NEGATIVE ASPECTS:Characters with this trait can grow frustrated with people who lack their speed and proficiency. Likewise, friends who don’t work as quickly might bristle under an efficient character’s impatience or annoyance. These characters can be so focused on finishing that they don’t pay close attention to detail and end up sacrificing quality for time.
