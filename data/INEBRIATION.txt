WRITER’S TIP:Depending on how quickly the liver metabolizes alcohol, inebriation symptoms will vary from person to person. Weight, body chemistry, and genetics are also factors in how well the body tolerates liquor. Because alcohol has an affinity for water, people with more fat tissue often take longer to reach peak BAC (Blood Alcohol Content).
