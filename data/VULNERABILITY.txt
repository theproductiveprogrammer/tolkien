VULNERABILITY
DEFINITION:Having one’s guard lowered; feeling emotionally exposed

NOTES:Vulnerability can be a positive, negative, or mixed experience. A vulnerable person who feels fear may display protective gestures while a hopeful person purposefully making himself vulnerable may express more optimistic or open actions. It is also common for a character to progress from protective to open movements if he feels safe.
